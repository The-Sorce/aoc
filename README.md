# Advent of Code PHP solutions

This repository includes my own, personal solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). Everything coded using PHP due to my nature as a mono-lingual one-trick pony. :D

## Framework

This project is built using the unofficial [Laravel Zero](https://laravel-zero.com/) micro-framework created by [Nuno Maduro](https://github.com/nunomaduro) and [Owen Voke](https://github.com/owenvoke) for building command-line applications.

## Tests

As Advent of Code offers good test cases, I have chosen to do a Test-driven development (TDD) approach to these puzzles, using the [Pest](https://pestphp.com/) testing framework.
